      <div class="block__35630">
        <P>
          It is our policy at FAITHCREDA & SONS to conduct all activities in a manner that the
          environment in which we operate is properly safeguarded. Our operations are conducted in
          line with the Company’s Environmental guidelines, standards, the requirements of our clients
          and all relevant Government agencies.
        </P>

        <p>
          We are dedicated to the precept of minimizing the effect of our operations on the
          environment. It is our belief that no operation can remain efficient if it is not environmental
          friendly, suitable and sustainable.
        </p>

        <P>
          An excellent educational program is put in place to enlighten all personnel in proper
          environmental awareness and recycling. Every employee is made to undergo an induction
          course in which environmental awareness is a prominent element. We consider it the duty of
          every employee to practice sound environmental management that will emphasize proper
          disposal of waste materials so as to maintain a clean and safe working environment.
        </P>

        <p>Every Staff of FAITHCREDA & SONS is expected to:</p>
        <ol>
          <li> Adhere to the practices for reporting spills and other environmentally unacceptable
            practices.
          </li>
          <li>
            Follow proper disposal methods, develop and maintain sound recycling efforts.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Accurate and timely spill reporting and other unfriendly environmental practices will afford
          management the opportunity to identify and eliminate the causes and effects of
          environmental spills and pollutions, which is the ultimate goal of our environmental policy.
        </p>

        <p>
          All sub-contractors are expected to conduct their activities in such a manner that is
          consistent with the Company’s Environmental Policy. Our goal is to work together in
          improving the environmental awareness of all persons involved in our operations.
